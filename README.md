# Behrang Saeedzadeh 👋

## About Me

- I code back-end, front-end, and CLI programs.
- I play chess, currently practicing Indian defence and attack, and watching games on YouTube.
- I use LLMs a lot -- just managed to run Gemma3:4B on my laptop using Ollama.

## Interests

- **Software Development**: Back-end services, REST APIs, front-end, extensions, and CLI programs.
- **Chess**: Not very methodical yes, but I enjoy playing it. Current ELO: ~1400.
- **AI & LLMs**: From generating images, making music and video, up to vibe coding and eveything in between.

## Current Projects

- **FOSS Chrome Extension**: Tab management on steroids (and asteroids)
- **Tooling Experiments**: OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot,  and the Zed editor
  - **Stopped using**: Claude, Claude Code, Replit, Cline, v0.dev
